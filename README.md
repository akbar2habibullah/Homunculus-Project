![Internal latent loop (7)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e176ad9-7004-4864-8009-3c8925f4702d)

This is a ~~simple~~ implementation of the iterable Transformer model, where the model can *rethink* its internal cognitive process with an internal confidence score as a guide. Akin of slow thinking mechanism.
So this is the simple explanation of how it works:
- We put an adjustable parameter to handle internal looping, the default value is 1.
- If the loss value is high, this iteration is triggered, with max iterations set to 10.
- We train an independent layer to output a confidence score, trained by loss value from the main training process.
- When inference, both the next token and confidence scores are outputted and can determine how many iterations are needed for the current inference.
- ~~No sophisticated tokenization or attention layer, just a pure simple transformer for learning purposes.~~ I'm adding GeGLU activation function, BPE tokenizer, selective 1D & 2D RoPE, safetensors, custom KV-caching, a simple vision encoder, grouped-query attention (GQA), RMS Norm, and PyTorch Lightning.

> Notes: I dunno why I'm impulsively adding unnecessary parts like ViT ğŸ™ƒ
